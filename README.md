WHY ARE ATOMS EMPTY.

At the center of an atom is a tiny nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons. This nucleus is extremely small compared to the whole atom. The electrons move around the nucleus in a large space, but they are so tiny and far apart from the nucleus that most of the atom is just empty. In fact, if the nucleus were the size of a small ball, the electrons would be moving around it as far away as the stands of a football stadium! That’s why we say atoms are 99.9999999% empty. But we don’t fall through things because the electrons in atoms push against each other, creating a force that keeps solid things from passing through each other.
